1. Views
   - app > Views
   - Where your views exist
   - It's good practice to have a folder per controller
   - Also good practice to have an html file per controller function
     - Index.html corresponds to index function on controller
1. Routes
   - app > Config > Roots.php
   - example.com/controllerClass/method/Id
